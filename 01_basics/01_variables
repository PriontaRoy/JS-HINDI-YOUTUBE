/*
prefer not to use var
because of issue in block scope and function scope
in java script we can write variables in two ways (var)&(let)now everyone use (let) because (var) has some limitations
In javaScript if we declare const after that we can not change that variables
We can also assign variables not using let and var
But Using let and var is perfect way to practice
